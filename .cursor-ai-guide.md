# Cursor AI Guide

## When Creating New Components

1. Use the template from `src/templates/ComponentTemplate.tsx`
2. Follow the section structure exactly as shown
3. Keep components under 50 lines
4. Place components in the correct folder structure
5. Include all required sections with proper headers

## When Modifying Existing Code

1. Maintain the existing section structure
2. Keep the 50-line limit in mind
3. Preserve the file location
4. Update the NOTES section with changes made
5. Follow the project's folder structure

## Required Sections in Every File

Every file must contain these sections in order:

1. IMPORTS
2. Types (if using TypeScript)
3. Hooks
4. Functions
5. Components
6. RENDER
7. EXPORTS
8. NOTES

## Folder Structure

- Components: `src/components/`
- Pages: `src/app/`
- API Routes: `src/app/api/`
- Styles: `src/styles/`
- Images: `src/images/`
- Fonts: `src/fonts/`

## Validation

Before submitting any code changes:

1. Run `npm run validate` to check against rules
2. Ensure all sections are present
3. Verify line count is under 50
4. Confirm file is in correct location
5. Check that NOTES section is updated

## Best Practices

1. Always use TypeScript
2. Follow single responsibility principle
3. Keep components small and focused
4. Use proper error handling
5. Document changes in NOTES section
